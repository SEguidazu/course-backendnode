This is the project I created based on Platzi's Backend with Node.js course.

Implement the logic of a chat capable of scaling as much as you require in real time with Node.js, the runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside the browser. Learn how to write JavaScript on the server. Master best practices, apply language architecture and understand the advantages of Node.js with Platzi.
